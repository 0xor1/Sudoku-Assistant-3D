Sudoku Solver Visualisation
===========================

A demo webGL application implemented using [mrdoob's](https://twitter.com/mrdoob) [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) library.

The main purpose is to allow users to enter an initial gameBoard state and then run a solver on the game,
whilst displaying to the user the logic used to make each value entry in a 3D animation.

Current progress demo available [here](http://www.0xor1.com/Sudoku).

A command line interface is also provided to show  model-view separation.
